Task 4 - Accident Hotspot & Risk Factor Analysis 

Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze U.S. road accident data to locate high-risk accident zones and understand the primary factors influencing accident occurrence. By combining data analysis with geospatial visualization, the project highlights regions and conditions where road accidents are most frequent.

Tools & Technologies:
Python (Google Colab)
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Folium (for interactive maps)

Dataset:
U.S. Accidents Dataset – March 2023
Large-scale dataset containing accident location, severity, weather, and visibility information

Methodology:
Connected Google Drive with Google Colab to efficiently manage the dataset
Cleaned and preprocessed raw data to remove inconsistencies and missing values
Used geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to identify accident hotspot areas
Examined influential factors such as weather conditions, visibility levels, and accident severity
Visualized insights using interactive maps and statistical plots

How to Run the Project:
Open the notebook in Google Colab
Mount Google Drive and place the dataset in the required folder
Execute cells sequentially to generate analysis and visual outputs

Outcomes & Learning:
Identified accident-prone regions across the U.S.
Discovered key environmental and situational risk factors contributing to accidents
Gained hands-on experience in large-scale data analysis and geospatial visualization
